network devices
repeater: works like an appllifier in a network
         - has only 2 ports
         - green dot tells that it is on
         - can communicate between only 2 layers
         - limitation on br
active hub: works in data link layer
passive hub: works in physical layer
hub:
8.8.8.8 = google dns
DNS: domain net server
NSA: national security Authority
gateway: that allows ping
